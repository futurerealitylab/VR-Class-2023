# Notes on customizing your avatar
1. To change the initial position of your avatar: go to [js/util/inline-viewer-helper.js](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/util/inline-viewer-helper.js) and change the values of [```this.lookYaw```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/util/inline-viewer-helper.js#L46), [```this.walkPosition```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/util/inline-viewer-helper.js#L47), [```this.lookPitch```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/util/inline-viewer-helper.js#L49). Notice that [```this.viewerHeight```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/util/inline-viewer-helper.js#L50) (the avatar's height) is set to be 1.6m from the [```inlineViewerHelper.setHeight(1.6)```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/immersive-pre.js#L503) in [js/immersive-pre.js](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/immersive-pre.js). You can change this if you like.
2. To customize your own avatar: go to [js/primitive/avatar.js](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/primitive/avatar.js). You can change the GLTF models used in the [```Headset```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/primitive/avatar.js#L101) and the [```Controller```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/primitive/avatar.js#L114) classes. You can add additional arguments to the [```initAvatar```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/primitive/avatar.js#L8) function to specify the avatar's look, and pass those values from the [```addPawn```](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-Class-2023/tree/master/js/util/croquetlib.js#L162) function.

# Notes on WebXR Croquet
1. Currently, we are only synchronizing the user's actions rather than the scene rendering, so all participants should start at the same time â€“ we do not yet support updating the scene for participants who join later.
2. In our current implementation, the Croquet session will start when the user clicks on the demoCroquet button, but the session will be dropped only when the person closes the webpage, or after the webpage has not been active for a long time. 
If you find that synchronization of participants has failed, try refreshing the page for all participants. This usually fixes it.
3. We are currently disabling the auto-reloading feature, because that feature might create unwanted multiple Croquet sessions.
